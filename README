This script creates a new Wordpress account with default data (user: superuser, pass: superuser).
Install in it in your wordpress installation directory i.e. where the wp-config.php resides.
Start your browser and access: yoursite/wordpress-install/wp-uc.php
This is useful when the automated process has failed for some reason to create the accounts.
You must immediately login and change the password of the newly created user.
After that please delete this file (wp-uc.php) to avoid any problems.
